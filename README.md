# Upgrades

- Cursor
	- "hold to click"
	- could run on subscription
- Main button
	- Add secondary "main button" but it doesn't do anything. 
	- Hide main button inside of a drop down?
	- Corporate Rebranding
		"Press Me" -> "Synergize"
	- Make button bounce when clicked
- Add assistant
	- Doesn't do anything. Just sits there and says random lines.
- "404 Upgrade Not Found"
	- Make it really expensive.
- Progress Bar
	- Add progress bar that just fills up forever.

- Can only press main button every 2s, can pay to fix.
- When they get to 50 clicks, break the upgrade
- Pay to fix upgrade, then cursor starts moving slightly.
- upgrade to HUGE button, right before you hit the big button, your subscription expires
	and you have to pay for more clicks. (If player doesnt have enough money, we float them a loan with insane interest. then like 10 clicks later say "nvm the loan shark died")
- As you attempt to pay for the cursor fix, the button moves away
- Pick a different upgrade for them


- Counter to add +1, etc whenever the thing is clicked.
