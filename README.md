# Upgrades

- Start off upgrading clicker strength
- When they get to 50 clicks, break the upgrade
- Pay to fix upgrade, then cursor starts moving slightly.
- Big button spawns, rewards 1
- upgrade to 2 big buttons, rewards 1
- upgrade to HUGE button, right before you hit the big button, your subscription expires
	and you have to pay for more clicks. (If player doesnt have enough money, we float them a loan with insane interest. then like 10 clicks later say "nvm the loan shark died")
- As you attempt to pay for the cursor fix, the button moves away
- Pick a different upgrade for them


- Counter to add +1, etc whenever the thing is clicked.
